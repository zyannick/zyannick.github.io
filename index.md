# Yannick Zoetgnande - AI Research Scientist

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Yannick, a multi-disciplinary AI research scientist based in Lyon, France.

ðŸ”¬ My work focuses on Fundamental AI Research. I have experience with images/video (Computer Vision, thermal imaging), biological data (peptides, ECG), and voice data (Emotion transfer in Speech).

ðŸ’¡ I enjoy developing innovative solutions and have experience in scalable data processing and MLOps. I'm proficient with cloud-based AI platforms like Google Vertex AI and have senior-authored papers in top journals and conferences.
